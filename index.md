When you trying to ssh by using the user name, remember to type 'ssh' following your user name for examaple ssh cs15lwi2ssss@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Several possibilities that could cause you fail to log in:

(1) add dollar sign before the ssh. It's going to show your command not found. Please retype ssh with your usernaame without dollar signã€‚

(2) type wrong passwords. If you type wrong passwords, you will see 'Password: ' again in a new line. It indicates you that you have to retype your 
correct password or username. It's highly recommoand to copy paste the password instead directly type.
